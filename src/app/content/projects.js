      name: "Colorado Mountain Lion Tracker",
      description: `The mountain community of Nederland, CO and surrounding areas were experiencing a high number of mountain lion encounters and residents were on edge. Locals were sharing descriptions of the locations, but it was hard to understand where those locations mapped to due to the winding back roads innate to mountain living. I made this Google Map integration so locals could easily submit new sightings that could be rendered immediately on the map. I also set up a Slack network for instant information sharing. The map displays a color-coded lion, which is calculated based on the encounter date, to make it visually easy to see where immediatey threats are locations.`,

Using Hostfully's booking API, I built out a search UI that queries results based on availability and selected criteria, so Mission Beach Villas could have more successful bookings and happier customers.",

      description: "Reading Rock's website was unmanagebale and broken. Reading Rock distributes hundreds of products nationwide, but the product they sell in each zip code is unique to the distributor serving the zip code and the customer type. They needed a complex filter option that would only render filter options based on the criteria for the zipcode and customer type. To quickly filter over thousands of available zip codes and data pairings, I brought in the data using a compressed data format. The rest is done via custom JavaScript classes. They also needed to change the displayed filters and keep dropdowns locked until earlier criteria were filled in, so I used JS event listeners to manipulate changes.",
